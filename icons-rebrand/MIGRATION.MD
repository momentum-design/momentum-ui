# New repository

https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-design/tree/main/packages/%40momentum-design/icons

## How to
Migrations produced from the source repository will be output to the npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@momentum-design/icons
Icons dist is backwards compatible so the only requirement is to change however one is importing the current icons distributable to the new dist folder from this npm package.
The old names will continue to be supported for at least 1 year. After 01/01/2024 that will be subject to change and old icon names and svgs will no longer be published.
